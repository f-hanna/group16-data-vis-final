                <p>
                    Born in the Bronx during the 1970s, hip hop has grown into a worldwide cultural movement, shaping
                    music, language, fashion, and activism (Hip Hop: A Culture of Vision and Voice) . Its adaptability
                    has led to the emergence of distinct subgenres, each reflecting unique regional styles, sounds, and
                    narratives. From the hard-hitting beats of Gangsta Rap to the melodic hooks of Trap, hip hop
                    continues to evolve while preserving its creative essence.
                    In this project, we explore hip hop's subgenres through three key aspects:<br><br>
                    <b>Influence and Popularity Over Time:</b> Charting the rise and evolution of subgenres across
                    decades.<br>
                    <b>Musical Qualities:</b> Examining rhythm, tempo, and melody that define each subgenre's sound.<br>
                    <b>Lyrical Themes & Language:</b> Highlighting recurring topics and language that give each style
                    its voice.

                (1980-2000, 2000-2010, 2010-2020). Categories such as "relationships," "violence," and "time" have

                <p>
                    This chapter presents the foundational elements of hip-hop music by analyzing melodic and lyrical
                    trends. It explores melodic features such as BPM, pitch, and volume, showcasing how these elements
                    shape the soundscapes of different subgenres. The lyrical analysis focuses on word usage, unique
                    word count, and category trends, illustrating shifts in thematic focus and lyrical complexity over
                    time.
                    By combining these melodic and lyrical insights, Chapter 2 highlights the relationship between
                    musical composition and storytelling– how these elements shape the identity and expression of the
                    genre over time.

                        <h5>BPM Parity Between BGM and Vocal: </h5>

                        <p>Almost half of the songs in Trap show similar BPM for their BGM and Vocal components. This
                            highlights a significant proportion of tracks where the vocal rhythm is tightly synchronized
                            with the instrumental beat.

                        <p>
                            For approximately half of the remaining tracks, the vocal BPM surpasses the BGM BPM. This
                            suggests that in these songs, vocal delivery is faster-paced, which could reflect the
                            influence of double-time flows or rapid-fire lyrical styles, a common feature in Trap music.

                    <p>The table and radar charts together provide a view of how lyrical themes vary across subgenres.
                        The table highlights the top and bottom 3 rankings for themes such as relationships, violence,
                        spirituality, and wealth,
                        with each column representing a thematic category and rows displaying the highest-ranking
                        subgenres.
                        For instance, Trap leads in slang and substance, while East Coast dominates appearance and
                        wealth.
                        Complementing this, the radar charts visually compare the thematic focus of each subgenre,
                        emphasizing distinct content areas like wealth, relationships, and emotion.
                        By juxtaposing each subgenre with Trap, the charts offer a clearer understanding of thematic
                        diversity and cultural influence within the lyrical content of these styles.</p>

                <p>This radar chart metric visualizes the relative emphasis on lyrical categories across various hip-hop
                    genres. Each axis represents a thematic category (e.g., wealth, violence, emotion), while the
                    distance from the center indicates the percentage of words in that category relative to the total
                    categorized words for the genre.

                <p>
                    <b>Axes Represent Themes: </b>Each axis corresponds to a specific lyrical theme, such as "emotion,"
                    "wealth," or "violence."

                <p>
                    <b>Distance from Center: </b>The farther a point is from the center, the higher the percentage of
                    words
                    associated with that theme, meaning the genre places more emphasis on it.

                    Normalized Metrics: The percentage calculation ensures normalization, allowing direct comparisons

                    rather than raw frequency.

                <p>This chapter analyzes the lyrical sentiment and melodic attributes including pitch and volume.
                    Analyzing sentiment visualizes the emotional journey within each song, capturing shifts between
                    positivity, negativity, and neutrality between the verses. On the melodic side, pitch and volume
                    visualizations highlight the tonal and dynamic layers that define hip-hop’s soundscape.
                    Together, these analyses illustrate the emotional and auditory diversity that shapes the
                    storytelling and energy of hip-hop music.

                <h2>3.1 Lyrical Sentiment</h2>
                <p>This sentiment barcode chart provides a detailed visualization of the sentiment trajectory within
                    each song. Each bar corresponds to a lyric line, with color-coded sentiment scores ranging from -1
                    (blue, negative) to 1 (orange, positive). The horizontal arrangement represents the sequence of
                    lyrics, forming a barcode for each song.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Individual Bars:</b> Each bar represents a single lyric line, its color reflecting the sentiment
                    score.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Barcodes for Songs:</b> The entire horizontal barcode signifies the sentiment distribution
                    throughout a
                    single song's lyrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Color Gradient:</b> Shades range from red for strongly negative sentiments, through white for
                    neutral
                    lines, to blue for highly positive sentiments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can click on each individual barcode to see the overall sentiment score of a song or click on
                    each stick to see a verse and its sentiment score.

                        <p>We conducted a frame-by-frame analysis of pitch and volume for the top 10 songs in each
                            subgenre,
                            visualizing each song on a pixel display with the horizontal axis representing time.
                            Each song features two tracks: the upper track for BGM and the lower track for vocals.<br>

                            <b>Similarities Among Top Songs: </b>There are notable similarities among the top songs,
                            particularly in their BGM. These include periodic high-frequency pitches and a generally
                            fast tempo with higher volume levels. In contrast, vocals tend to dominate the higher
                            frequencies but exhibit relatively lower volumes. While further insights could be drawn from
                            direct comparisons between specific songs, we do not delve deeper here.<br>

                            observed across subgenres. For instance, the frequency of high-pitched sounds in the BGM of
                            Boom Amp is significantly lower compared to Trap. This highlights Trap as a genre
                            characterized by faster tempos and more frequent intermittent high-frequency sounds,
                            distinguishing it from other subgenres.

                            In addition to similarities, distinct differences in time-frequency characteristics can be
                            observed across subgenres. For instance, the frequency of high-pitched sounds in the BGM of
                            Boom Amp is significantly lower compared to Trap. This highlights Trap as a genre
                            characterized by faster tempos and more frequent intermittent high-frequency sounds,
                            distinguishing it from other subgenres.
